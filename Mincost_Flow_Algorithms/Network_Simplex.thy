section \<open>Abstract data types for the algorithm\<close>

text \<open>Vertex potentials and edge reduced costs are not stored as plain reals. We use two abstract
      \emph{real descriptors}, each abstracted to @{typ real} by a verification-only function that is
      never executed:
      \<^item> a \<^emph>\<open>potential descriptor\<close> @{typ 'p} for the vertex potentials held in the potential array ---
        with invariant \<open>pot_value_invar\<close>, abstraction \<open>pot_value_abstract\<close>, and the two \<^emph>\<open>mixed\<close>
        operations \<open>pot_value_plus, pot_value_minus :: 'p \<Rightarrow> 'r \<Rightarrow> 'p\<close> that shift a potential by a
        reduced cost;
      \<^item> a \<^emph>\<open>reduced-cost descriptor\<close> @{typ 'r} for the value \<open>\<gamma>\<close> the selector returns --- with invariant
        \<open>rcost_invar\<close> and abstraction \<open>rcost_abstract\<close>; it carries no arithmetic of its own (reduced
        costs are never combined with one another).
      The two mixed operations are specified only \<^emph>\<open>conditionally\<close> (axioms \<open>pot_value_plus_spec\<close> /
      \<open>pot_value_minus_spec\<close>): their abstraction law and invariant preservation are guaranteed only
      when the resulting real value is admissible --- a signed edge-cost sum in which \<^emph>\<open>at most one\<close> edge
      touches the root \<open>r\<close> (the predicate \<open>good_pot_val\<close> below). Every potential the algorithm
      maintains is a tree-path cost sum reaching \<open>r\<close> exactly once, so the guard always holds where the
      operations are used. This split and its guard are exactly what later let us realise the
      ``big-M'' method with a pair representation \<open>(m, o)\<close> (an M-coefficient and an ordinary part)
      without numerical-stability issues: the \<open>\<le> 1\<close> root-edge bound keeps \<open>\<bar>m\<bar> \<le> 1\<close> and the
      edge-cost-sum bound keeps the ordinary part from overflowing, so componentwise add/subtract stay
      exact and the constant \<open>M\<close> --- occurring only inside the abstraction --- is chosen once and never
      explicitly computed.\<close>

text \<open>The entering-edge (pivot) rule is abstracted as a small stateful ADT: an invariant
      @{term sel_invar} and a selection function @{term sel_select}. Given the current potentials
      and the two sets @{term L} and @{term U}, the selector returns either @{term None} (no eligible
      edge --- the optimality stopping condition) or @{term "Some (e, in_U, \<gamma>, sel')"}: an entering
      edge @{term e}, a flag telling whether it came from @{term U} (@{term True}) or @{term L}
      (@{term False}), a descriptor @{term \<gamma>} of its reduced cost in the abstract real type, and an
      updated selector. The behavioural specification (invariant preservation and eligibility of the
      returned edge) is added in the proof locale.\<close>

section \<open>Specification locale for the network simplex algorithm\<close>

text \<open>The specification locale conjoins the cost-flow network (@{locale cost_flow_network}, source
      of the costs @{term \<open>\<c>\<close>} and the extended-real capacities @{term \<open>\<u>\<close>}), the spanning-tree ADT
      (@{locale arborescense_adt}), and the array-/set-like stores realising the program state:
      \<^item> @{term flow_lookup} --- an @{locale fixed_univ_map} mapping every edge to its current flow (a
        @{typ real});
      \<^item> @{term pot_lookup} --- an @{locale fixed_univ_map} mapping every vertex to its potential,
        represented in the abstract potential-descriptor type @{typ 'p} (reduced costs use the
        separate descriptor type @{typ 'r}; see the two real-descriptor families above);
      \<^item> @{term parent_lookup} --- an @{locale fixed_univ_map} over the vertices @{term \<open>V - {r}\<close>}
        giving, for each vertex, the graph edge to its predecessor on the path to the root, and
      \<^item> @{term dir_lookup} --- a boolean @{locale fixed_univ_map} over @{term \<open>V - {r}\<close>} recording the
        orientation of that parent edge;
      \<^item> @{term es_lookup} --- an @{locale fixed_univ_map} mapping every edge to its @{typ edge_tag}
        state: @{term InTree} (in the spanning tree), @{term InL} (zero-flow, the former @{term L}) or
        @{term InU} (saturated, the former @{term U}). The zero-flow and saturated edge sets are the
        verification-only views \<open>ns_L_of\<close> / \<open>ns_U_of\<close> carved out of @{term \<open>\<E>\<close>} by the tag.
      In addition we fix the balances @{term b} (the cost-flow network has none) and an executable
      capacity @{term cap} on the reals in which @{term \<open>- 1\<close>} plays the role of infinity, linked to
      the abstract @{term \<open>\<u>\<close>} by the assumptions \<open>cap_infinite\<close> and \<open>cap_finite\<close>. We assume the
      graph has no self-loops (\<open>no_self_loop\<close>), so every entering edge has two distinct endpoints and
      hence a well-defined fundamental circuit (@{term get_path_pair} is specified only for @{term \<open>u \<noteq> v\<close>}).
      The assumptions
      \<open>sel_select_Some\<close> and \<open>sel_select_None\<close> specify the behaviour of the entering-edge selection;

section \<open>The network simplex loop\<close>

text \<open>We assemble the loop over the program state, following steps 2--6 of the algorithm. Its body
      branches on the four criteria: (i) whether the selector finds an entering edge at all
      (@{term None} --- the structure is optimal); (ii) whether that edge comes from @{term L} or
      @{term U} (the @{term in_U} flag, which fixes the orientation of the fundamental circuit);
      (iii) whether the circuit's bottleneck is infinite (an unbounded negative cycle); and (iv)
      whether the entering edge is itself the bottleneck --- then it merely flips between @{term L} and
      @{term U} with no tree change (@{term ns_flip}) --- or a genuine tree edge leaves and a full pivot
      is performed (@{term ns_pivot}).

      Residual capacities are handled on the reals with @{term \<open>- 1\<close>} as the infinity sentinel
      (matching @{term cap}), and the fundamental circuit is never materialised --- the bottleneck and
      the flow augmentation fold in place over the two vertex paths @{term get_path_pair} returns ---
      so every operation is executable. The @{term parent_edge} / @{term edge_dir} arrays are
      re-parented in place after each swap (@{term reparent}). The orientation conventions --- the
      first/last bottleneck tie-break, the per-side residual directions, the flow-augmentation signs,
      the leaving-edge @{term L}/@{term U} assignment, and the potential-shift sign
      @{term \<open>in_U \<noteq> up_side\<close>} --- have all been cross-checked against LEMON's reference
