Small Changes


- move to_dbltn, or reuse an equivalent definition from Undirected Graphs. 
      (there is to_dbltn in Jarnik Prim, set_of_pair in Pair_Graph_U_Specs, an assumed to_dbltn in Max_Bipartite_Matching)
- intro and elim rule for every definition
- no unnamed contexts in matroids, greedoids
- vwalk_bet and walk_betw: we need to have better names
- Separate session for graphs to LPs
- Unify notion of graph difference, move to graph library
- Unify notion of perfect matching, move to matching session (Berge's lemma now)
- add tsp approximation and complexity


Big Changes

- add Hypergraphs (new representation)
- locales, extensible records, restructure all ADTs with extensible records
- Add adaptor for Wimmer's graph library
- Imperative Implementations
