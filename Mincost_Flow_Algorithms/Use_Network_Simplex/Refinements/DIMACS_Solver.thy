section \<open>The DIMACS solver, assembled\<close>

text \<open>The three theories before this one each solve one part of the problem and stop there.
      \<open>Mincost_Solver_Reduction\<close> turns a parsed DIMACS instance into the standard shape the library
      reasons about, and says what each of the three possible answers about the reduced instance
      means for the original one.  \<open>Mincost_Oracle_Certificates\<close> takes an instance in that shape,
      hands it to an untrusted solver, checks the certificate that comes back, and --- if the check
      fails --- defers to a verified procedure.  \<open>Network_Simplex_Int\<close> \<^emph>\<open>is\<close> such a verified
      procedure.  This theory puts the three together.

      Two things are worth saying about what is assumed here.

      \<^item> \<^emph>\<open>The functional locale assumes exactly what the reduction assumes.\<close>  The reduction is the
        first step, so its well-formedness conditions on the parsed lists are unavoidable; nothing
        else is.  In particular the oracle is a plain parameter with no assumption whatever, and the
        cleanup is \<^emph>\<open>not\<close> a parameter at all --- it is the network simplex, and the obligation
        \<open>cleanup_correct\<close> of @{locale mcf_oracle_cleanup} is discharged, not assumed.

      \<^item> \<^emph>\<open>The numbers are integers.\<close>  A DIMACS instance is integral by definition, so the numeric
        type is @{typ int} and the embedding into the reals of @{locale real_embedding} is
        @{const of_int} --- the genuine one.  Nothing in the pipeline is left generic, and code
        generation emits arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic.\<close>


subsection \<open>An integer square root\<close>

text \<open>The pivot rule is tuned by three counts, and the sizes that work well in practice are all
      \<^emph>\<open>square-root shaped\<close>.  Newton's iteration on @{typ nat} gives one: it halves the error each
      step, so the fuel below is never exhausted in practice and is there only to make the recursion
      structural.

      \<^emph>\<open>Nothing is proved about this function and nothing needs to be.\<close>  The pivot rule enters the
      correctness proof only through @{term \<open>0 < block_size\<close>} and two conditions like it, and those
      are secured by the @{const max} in the definitions further down, whatever this returns.  A bad
      answer here would cost time, never soundness --- which is the status a tuning knob should
      have.\<close>

fun isqrt_iter :: "nat \<Rightarrow> nat \<Rightarrow> nat \<Rightarrow> nat" where
  "isqrt_iter n 0 x = x"
| "isqrt_iter n (Suc f) x = (let y = (x + n div x) div 2 in if y < x then isqrt_iter n f y else x)"

definition isqrt :: "nat \<Rightarrow> nat" where
  "isqrt n = (if n = 0 then 0 else isqrt_iter n n n)"

subsection \<open>The fallback, imperatively\<close>

text \<open>The verified network simplex, packaged as the fallback the certifier's pipeline expects.  Two
      things have to be arranged around it.  \<^emph>\<open>The balance array is a different shape\<close>: the pipeline
      carries the reduced instance's balances, of length @{term \<open>Suc n\<close>} with the reserved slot
      @{term \<open>0::nat\<close>} first, whereas the simplex wants a name-indexed array of length
      @{term \<open>Suc (Suc n)\<close>} whose last cell is the artificial root's zero balance.  Since the
      reserved slot \<^emph>\<open>is\<close> zero, the second is the first with a zero appended, so one allocation and
      one copy suffice --- and this is the rejected-certificate path, so an @{term n}-sized copy
      costs nothing.  \<^emph>\<open>The status is a different type\<close>, and is renamed.

      Like every other program here it is defined outside all locales, and it takes the tuning
      parameters as arguments.\<close>

      same length otherwise.  The placeholder is never computed --- the program does not reach the

subsection \<open>The fallback: the verified network simplex\<close>

text \<open>The certifier's fallback takes the instance and a flow and must return a true verdict.  The
      network simplex of \<open>Network_Simplex_Int\<close> is exactly such a procedure, so the fallback is not a
      parameter here --- it is that procedure, run on the reduced instance.

      Two adjustments are needed to hand it the oracle's flow as a warm start.  \<^emph>\<open>The flow must be
      capacity-feasible\<close>, which the oracle's is not known to be: it is untrusted, and by the time the
      fallback runs its certificate has already been rejected.  So the flow is clamped, in one pass,
      into the admissible box --- a negative entry up to @{term \<open>0::int\<close>}, an entry above a finite
      capacity down to it, an uncapacitated arc left alone.  \<^emph>\<open>The flow must have the right length\<close>,
      which again is not known, so the pass is over @{term \<open>[0..<m]\<close>} and reads a missing entry
      as @{term \<open>0::int\<close>}.  Neither adjustment is a correctness argument: a warm start is a
      performance device, and the network simplex is correct from any feasible start.\<close>

definition ns_clamp :: "int \<Rightarrow> int \<Rightarrow> int" where
  "ns_clamp c x = (if x < 0 then 0 else if c \<noteq> - 1 \<and> c < x then c else x)"

  "ns_flow g = map (\<lambda> e. ns_clamp (red_upper ! e) (if e < length g then g ! e else 0)) [0..<m]"

text \<open>The three tuning parameters of the candidate-list pivot rule, \<^emph>\<open>computed from the instance\<close>:
      the block scanned between two boundary checks, the capacity of the candidate list, and the
      floor below which a block boundary does not stop the scan.  The shapes are those of the
      reference implementation the untrusted oracle is derived from, which sets its block to the
      square root of the number of arcs it prices (floor ten), its candidate list to a quarter of
      that (floor ten), and its minor limit to a tenth of the list (floor three).

      \<^emph>\<open>Which arc count.\<close>  The reference implementation, on an instance whose balances sum to zero
      --- which the reduction guarantees --- prices the \<^emph>\<open>original\<close> arcs only: its artificial arcs
      start in the tree and are never scanned.  So the count taken here is the arc count of the
      problem line, the reduction leaving it unchanged.  A different value would cost time and never
      soundness: the selector is correct whatever the three parameters are.

      The parameters are \<^emph>\<open>derived\<close>, not fixed, and the @{const max} does double duty: it is the
      floor the reference implementation uses \<^emph>\<open>and\<close> it is what makes \<open>0 < block_size\<close>,
      \<open>0 < min_candidates\<close> and \<open>min_candidates \<le> max_candidates\<close> facts rather than assumptions.
      That is what keeps this locale free of anything the reduction does not already assume.\<close>

text \<open>Reduce, solve, read the answer back.  The reduction rewrites the caller's capacity and balance
      arrays in place and leaves the arcs, the costs and the lower bounds where they were, so the
      pipeline is handed the very same six arrays; one array is allocated, for the flow the oracle
      fills.  The certifier's pipeline runs the oracle, checks its certificate and falls back on the
      network simplex; and on an optimal answer @{const orig_flow_imp} adds the lower bounds back in
      place, so the cells of that array are the DIMACS flow.

      The immediate check is honoured first: an arc of empty range, an out-of-range balance or a
      non-zero balance sum makes the instance infeasible and nothing is solved.  The flow array is
      returned in every case --- it is the caller's to free --- but only the \<^emph>\<open>True\<close> answer says
      anything about it.  The capacity and balance arrays come back holding the \<^emph>\<open>reduced\<close> instance:
      the reduction is in place, and what the caller still needs is the lower bounds and the flow.\<close>

text \<open>\<^emph>\<open>The solver is correct.\<close>  Run on the arrays of a parsed instance, it answers @{term True} only
      with an optimal DIMACS flow in the array it returns, and @{term False} only when the instance
      has no flow at all.  Nothing in the statement mentions the reduction, the certificates or the
      simplex: they are the \<^emph>\<open>method\<close>, and what is claimed is a property of the problem on the
      problem's own terms.  The capacity and balance arrays are left existential: the reduction has
      overwritten them, and nothing downstream reads them again.

      The proof splits on the feasibility flag, because the certifier's instance is the reduced one
      only when the flag holds --- and it is the flag that decides whether the pipeline runs at all.
      Three heap rules do the rest, \<open>reduce_imp_rule\<close>, \<open>solve_imp'_correct\<close> (whose two obligations

text \<open>\<^emph>\<open>The marker is exact.\<close>  The theorem above gives the two implications; because the answer is a
      \<^emph>\<open>boolean\<close>, they are together a biconditional, and it is worth stating as one.  A DIMACS
      instance whose bounds are integers has finite capacities on every arc, so its feasible region
      is a bounded polyhedron: if it has a flow at all then it has an optimal one.  Hence the flag is
      set exactly when the instance is feasible --- \<open>True\<close> is never returned without an optimum to

subsection \<open>The empty instance\<close>

text \<open>An instance with no arcs is the one case the pipeline cannot be run on: the certifier's format
      asks for at least one arc, and with none there is nothing for an oracle to solve.  It is also
      the one case that needs no solving.  With no arcs every flow has zero excess everywhere and
      zero cost, so the instance is feasible exactly when every balance is @{term \<open>0::int\<close>}, and then
      the empty flow is optimal --- which is why the program answers from the feasibility flag alone
      and returns the array of length @{term \<open>0::nat\<close>} that @{term \<open>Array.new 0\<close>} allocates.

      That the flag says the right thing is the content below.  The reduction's own rule is
      unavailable here, being stated in a locale that assumes an arc, so the pass is re-run at
      @{term \<open>0::nat\<close>} arcs: the arc loop and the four shifts are empty, and what is left is the
      three vertex sweeps, whose conjunction pins every balance between @{term \<open>0::int\<close>} and
      @{term \<open>0::int\<close>}.\<close>

subsection \<open>The theorem about the exported code\<close>

text \<open>Finally the same statement with \<^emph>\<open>no locale left\<close>.  The locale's assumptions become premises:
      the nine well-formedness conditions on the six input lists --- the lengths, a non-empty node
      range and endpoints that name declared nodes --- and, separately, \<open>dimacs_solver_imp_axioms\<close>,
      which is the pair of oracle assumptions \<open>oracle_imp_rule\<close> and \<open>oracle_wf\<close> of the locale above.
      That one is not a condition on the input and cannot be discharged here: the oracle is an
      external program, and the assumption says only that it refines the functional oracle.

      The optimality is spelled out too, since \<open>original_network\<close> is gone with the locale: it is
      \<open>dimacs_spec.is_dimacs_Opt\<close>, the reduction's formalisation of the DIMACS problem, at the
      endpoints, capacities, costs, lower bounds and supplies read off the input lists, over the

text \<open>The same code, written into the generated_sml directory -- the one the MLton build
      compiles from -- so that an external driver can compile it: the solver, the reduction and
      the back-transformation, plus the integer constructors a driver needs in order to build the
      six input arrays.

      It used to be written next to this theory and copied into generated_sml by hand. The copy is
      what the driver builds, so a forgotten copy step meant building against code that was no
      longer what had been proved -- and nothing about that failure is visible from the outside:
      every test passes, against the wrong program. Writing it where the build reads it does not
      detect that, it makes it impossible. The path is still anchored at this theory's own
      directory, so generation stays unaware of how the surrounding project is organised.\<close>
