section \<open>Imperative refinement of the acyclic-flow procedure\<close>

text \<open>This theory mirrors the functional specification locale @{locale acyclic_flow_impl_spec}, but
      every store the algorithm mutates — the flow, the three-valued vertex-state map, the two
      per-vertex edge iterators, the vertex iterator of the outer loop and the three parallel DFS
      stacks — is now a \<^emph>\<open>mutable heap object\<close>, and every operation is lifted into the @{typ \<open>_ Heap\<close>}
      monad. Every fixed operation and every derived constant carries an @{text \<open>_imp\<close>} suffix so that
      this locale can later be combined with the functional locales without name clashes.

      The refinement discipline is the standard Imperative-HOL one:
      \<^item> a functional operation that \<^emph>\<open>changes\<close> a data structure (a flow update, a vertex-state write,
        advancing / resetting an iterator) becomes an in-place mutation with result type
        @{typ \<open>unit Heap\<close>} — the structure is changed but \<^emph>\<open>not returned\<close>;
      \<^item> a functional operation that \<^emph>\<open>changes a container and also returns a proper value\<close> drops the
        container from the returned tuple — it is mutated in place — and returns only the value(s) in
        the @{typ \<open>_ Heap\<close>} monad (e.g.\ the cancellation returns just its drop count and unbounded
        flag, the flow having been augmented in place);
      \<^item> a functional operation that \<^emph>\<open>computes a value\<close> (a lookup, an endpoint projection, a room /
        cost combination) returns that value in the @{typ \<open>_ Heap\<close>} monad;
      \<^item> pure arithmetic on values already read out of the heap stays pure.

      The three functional DFS stacks @{term af_vstack} / @{term af_estack} / @{term af_dstack} become
      three \<^emph>\<open>mutable arrays\<close> @{term ivstack} / @{term iestack} / @{term idstack} together with a
      \<^emph>\<open>stack pointer\<close> @{term sp} that is threaded as an ordinary @{typ nat} argument (a value on the
      heap), rather than a boxed length. The intended (never here assumed — this belongs to the proof
      locale) layout is: @{term ivstack} holds the trail vertices in indices \<open>[0..<sp]\<close> with the
      top at \<open>sp - 1\<close>; for \<open>1 \<le> i < sp\<close> the entries \<open>iestack ! i\<close> /
      \<open>idstack ! i\<close> hold the arc / direction by which \<open>ivstack ! i\<close> was entered from its
      parent \<open>ivstack ! (i - 1)\<close>. Index \<open>0\<close> of the arc / direction stacks (the DFS root)
      is unused.

      The @{term af_unbounded} flag is not stored: exactly as the network-simplex loop returns a
      status value, the loops here \<^emph>\<open>return a boolean\<close> — @{term True} meaning an unbounded
      instance (a negative infinite-capacity free cycle) was detected — and leave the mutated flow store
      in place for the caller to read.

      This locale fixes only the imperative operations; it states \<^emph>\<open>no assumptions\<close>. Every text below
      describes how a fixed imperative function is meant to be used, it is not an axiom.\<close>

subsection \<open>The imperative program state\<close>

text \<open>The mutable program state. The flow, vertex-state, edge-iterator and vertex-iterator stores of
      the two functional program states become handles to heap objects (mutated in place, so the
      handles are threaded unchanged), plus the three DFS-stack arrays.\<close>

text \<open>The two edge iterators are per-vertex: @{term out_current_imp} / @{term in_current_imp} \<^emph>\<open>read\<close>
      the current outgoing / ingoing arc of a vertex, @{term out_has_imp} / @{term in_has_imp} report

      and @{term out_reset_imp} / @{term in_reset_imp} reset it to its full unconsumed state (copied
      from the pristine originals) \<^emph>\<open>in place\<close>. @{term flow_upd_imp} / @{term st_upd_imp} write, and
      @{term flow_lookup_imp} / @{term st_lookup_imp} read, the flow and vertex-state stores. The
      vertex iterator @{term current_vertex_imp} / @{term has_vertex_imp} / @{term move_on_vertex_imp}
      hands out the vertices of the outer loop, advancing in place. @{term cap_imp} reads an edge
      capacity (@{term \<open>- 1\<close>} = \<infinity>), @{term cost_imp} its unit cost, and @{term fst_exec_imp} /
      @{term snd_exec_imp} its two endpoints.\<close>

text \<open>Second pass — push @{term \<gamma>} around the same cycle \<^emph>\<open>and\<close> locate the bottleneck. Each cycle arc

      To keep the pass in \<^emph>\<open>constant stack space\<close> it is written \<^emph>\<open>tail-recursively\<close>: rather than

      the running depth @{term dep} (@{term 1} at the top) and the deepest saturated depth @{term best}
      seen so far (@{term 0} = none). Because the walk descends towards @{term x}, a later (deeper) hit

section \<open>The refinement proof locale\<close>

text \<open>The proof locale combines the functional proof locale @{locale acyclic_flow_impl} — which
      supplies the cost-flow network (hence the vertex set @{term \<V>} and edge set @{term \<E>}), the
      functional ADT operations and \<^emph>\<open>all their assumed laws\<close>, and the correctness of the functional
      \<open>make_acyclic\<close> — with the imperative code locale @{locale acyclic_flow_impl_refine}.

      For each mutable store it fixes a \<^emph>\<open>representation assertion\<close> relating a functional store value to
      its imperative heap handle (@{typ assn} is the separation-logic heap predicate): @{term flow_assn}
      for the flow, @{term state_assn} for the vertex-state map, @{term graph_assn} for either
      edge-iterator collection (used at @{term iout} and @{term iin} alike), and @{term vit_assn} for
      the vertex iterator.

      It then \<^emph>\<open>assumes one Hoare triple per imperative operation\<close>. The discipline is:
      \<^item> a mutating operation (result @{typ \<open>unit Heap\<close>}) turns the pre-representation of the store into
        the representation of the \<^emph>\<open>functionally updated\<close> store, with no returned value;
      \<^item> a reading operation returns the value the \<^emph>\<open>functional\<close> operation computes, keeping the
        representation unchanged;
      \<^item> the pure endpoint / capacity / cost reads have an empty footprint.

      Crucially, the \<^emph>\<open>pure logical preconditions of each triple are exactly the hypotheses of the
      corresponding functional ADT law(s)\<close> — the refinement assertion alone does not guarantee that the
      \<^emph>\<open>inputs have the right structure\<close> (the ADT invariant, the key-set membership, a non-empty
      remainder), so those hypotheses must \<^emph>\<open>still be assumed\<close>. For the flow store that is
      @{term \<open>flow_invar Fl\<close>} together with the key-set membership @{term \<open>e \<in> \<E>\<close>} (mirroring the law
      \<open>fixed_univ_map.fixed_univ_map_upd\<close>); for the vertex-state store @{term \<open>st_invar St\<close>} and
      @{term \<open>v \<in> \<V>\<close>}; for the two indexed edge iterators @{term \<open>out_invar G\<close>} resp.\ @{term \<open>in_invar G\<close>},
      @{term \<open>v \<in> \<V>\<close>}, and — for the \<open>current\<close>/\<open>move\<close> steps — the extra @{term \<open>out_remaining G v \<noteq> {}\<close>}
      / @{term \<open>in_remaining G v \<noteq> {}\<close>} (mirroring \<open>indexed_iterable_set.idx_current\<close> and
      \<open>indexed_iterable_set.idx_move_invar\<close>); and for the vertex iterator @{term \<open>vit_invar Vit\<close>} plus,
      for \<open>current\<close>/\<open>move_on\<close>, @{term \<open>vit_remaining Vit \<noteq> {}\<close>} (mirroring \<open>iterable_set.has_current\<close>

text \<open>The inner DFS loop refines @{const AF_DFS_impl}, by \<^emph>\<open>fixpoint induction\<close> on the heap
      @{command partial_function}. The added premise @{term \<open>multigraph_inv out_arr in_arr\<close>} is the
      standing correctness precondition of the whole acyclic-flow development (the input graph arrays
      genuinely represent the graph); it is what @{thm AF_inv_holds_1} etc. require and is threaded to
      the top. The functional side varies over @{term st} / @{term sp}; the imperative state @{term s}
