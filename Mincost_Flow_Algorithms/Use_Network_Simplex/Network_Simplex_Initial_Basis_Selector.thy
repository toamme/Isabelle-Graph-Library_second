section \<open>A concrete entering-edge selector: candidate-list block search\<close>

text \<open>We implement the @{locale edge_selector} ADT concretely, following the improved block-search
      pseudocode.  The selector state is a record holding a wrap-around \<^emph>\<open>bookmark\<close> into the
      augmented arc set @{term \<open>{0..<m + Kart}\<close>} (an arc is its own index, so \<open>arc_array ! i = i\<close>)
      and a \<^emph>\<open>candidate list\<close> of shortlisted edge ids.  A single call to the selection function
      sees the potentials @{term \<pi>} and the edge-tag array @{term es} as constants; all persistence
      lives in the record, threaded as the ADT's selector value.

      The rule proceeds in two phases.  \<^bold>\<open>Minor iteration\<close> (@{text scan_best}) re-prices the cached
      candidate list against the current @{term \<pi>}/@{term es}, drops the edges that are no longer
      eligible, and returns the most-violating survivor --- so a returned edge is always eligible
      \<^emph>\<open>now\<close>, which is all the ADT demands.  \<^bold>\<open>Major iteration\<close> (@{text scan}) is reached only when the
      cache is exhausted; it sweeps the arc array in blocks from the bookmark, refilling the cache
      (up to @{term max_candidates}) and simultaneously tracking the best edge to return, with a
      ceiling bailout (list full) and a floor bailout (enough fuel, checked at block boundaries).
      If a full sweep of all @{term \<open>m + Kart\<close>} arcs inserts nothing, no eligible edge exists and the
      selector returns @{term None} --- discharging the ADT's @{term None} contract, from which the
      outer loop later derives optimality.\<close>

text \<open>Try the cache first; on a hit keep the pruned survivors (bookmark unchanged).  Otherwise run a
      major iteration from the bookmark: return its best, or @{term None} if the whole arc set was
      swept without finding an eligible edge.\<close>


text \<open>The selector invariant records only structural facts about the state --- it cannot mention
      @{term \<pi>} (the ADT invariant sees the selector alone), which is exactly why the minor iteration
      re-validates every cached edge before returning it.  The range bound is stated about the
      \<^emph>\<open>live prefix\<close> @{term \<open>take (sel_len sel) (sel_arr sel)\<close>} (its members are genuine arcs, so a
      returned edge lies in @{term \<E>}); the stale tail beyond the pointer is unconstrained.  The fixed
      capacity is pinned by @{term \<open>length (sel_arr sel) = max_candidates\<close>}, which keeps the pointer a
      legal index for insertion.  Candidate-list \<^emph>\<open>distinctness\<close> is deliberately \<^emph>\<open>not\<close> asserted: the
      ADT axioms never need it (the loop treats \<open>sel_invar_impl\<close> abstractly), so requiring it

subsection \<open>Pricing bridge: reduced-cost faithfulness from the good-potential invariant\<close>

text \<open>The remaining ADT obligation.  The two selector theorems above are stated with the abstract

      @{term \<open>rc_invar (red_cost \<pi> e)\<close>}.  Both are discharged from the good-potential invariant that the

      edges touching the artificial root @{term vcount} at most once (the descriptor-level
      \<open>good_pot_val_c\<close>, the concrete instance of @{term good_pot_val}), and the root's own
      potential is zero.  Under it the coefficient of every potential lies in @{term \<open>{- 1, 0, 1}\<close>} and
      its ordinary part is bounded by @{term \<open>sum_list (map abs cost_list)\<close>}; the clamped tag arithmetic
      is then \<^emph>\<open>faithful\<close> because the reduced-cost coefficient never leaves @{term \<open>{- 2 .. 2}\<close>} (an

subsection \<open>A combined DFS invariant: component-root direction and artificial-edge fields\<close>

text \<open>Obligation 9 (strong feasibility) needs, at every component root @{term c}, the tree-edge
      direction @{term \<open>ds_dir (build_tree acyc_flow) ! c = art_dir c\<close>} and the artificial edge's tag/flow/cap.
      These four facts are carried through the builder as a single invariant \<open>cr_ext_inv\<close>,
      proved together with @{const comproot_inv} in one shared @{const build_dfs}/@{const open_tree_component}/
      @{const emit_U_edge}/fold induction.  The direction is frozen by @{const build_dfs} at already-seen
      vertices (\<open>build_dfs_dir_frozen\<close>); the artificial-edge fields sit below the tail cursor and are
      frozen by @{thm build_dfs_art} and update-at-a-fresh-index reasoning.\<close>

text \<open>Obligation 9 (\<open>init_strict\<close>, strong feasibility): each non-root tree vertex's parent edge
      is strictly interior in the required direction.  Interior edges are free (both residual bounds

section \<open>The @{locale network_simplex_init} interpretation for the constructed initial basis\<close>

text \<open>Extending @{term NS} with the concrete starting basis produced by @{const build_tree}: the flow
      @{const flow_all}, the potentials @{term \<open>ds_pot (build_tree acyc_flow)\<close>}, the arborescence @{term Sarb}, the
      parent/direction maps @{term \<open>ds_par (build_tree acyc_flow)\<close>} / @{term \<open>ds_dir (build_tree acyc_flow)\<close>}, the edge-state
      array @{const state_all} and the selector seed @{const init_sel}. Because @{term NS} already
      discharges every \<open>network_simplex_spec\<close> axiom, \<open>unfold_locales\<close> leaves only the 10
      @{locale network_simplex_init} obligations. Seven are now proved --- the trivial store invariant,
      the tree invariant @{thm arb_invar_Sarb}, the selector seed (@{thm NSinit_sel_invar}), the
      flow/edge-partition fit (@{thm NSinit_flow_fits}), the potential fit (@{thm NSinit_pot_fits}),
      strong feasibility (@{thm NSinit_strict}) and the tree correspondence (@{thm NSinit_tree_corr}).
      The remaining three (the store validity @{term \<open>NS.pot_valid\<close>}, the \<open>b\<close>-flow and the
      spanning-tree partition) each need extra carried invariants and are left as \<^emph>\<open>sorry\<close> for now.\<close>

subsection \<open>Validity of the initial potentials (obligation 2 / init\_pot\_valid)\<close>

text \<open>The built potential is a valid network-simplex potential: it satisfies the store-length
      invariant and, at every vertex, the good-potential certificate good\_pot\_val\_c together with
      the descriptor bound pv\_invar. The certificate is obtained from a closed form of the
      potential as a signed sum of tree-path edge costs (pot\_repr), proved by well-founded
      induction along the parent relation; distinctness of the path edges (par\_inj) keeps the
      cost sums honest, and exactly one artificial (root-incident) edge sits at the top of each
      path, which is what bounds the root-incident count by one.\<close>

section \<open>Total correctness of the solver\<close>

text \<open>The final statement about solve, phrased entirely in terms of the original network: the
      original\_network sublocales, whose edge set is 0 ..< m, whose capacities and costs are read off
      capacity\_list and cost\_list, and whose balance is b\_lookup. Neither the Kart artificial edges
      nor the big-M costs occur anywhere below; they are an internal device of the search, and the
      three verdicts speak only about the problem the caller posed.

      Optimum carries a flow on the m original edges that is a minimum-cost b\_lookup-flow
      (original\_network.is\_Opt): feasible, and no feasible flow is cheaper.

      Infeasible certifies that the original network admits no b\_lookup-flow at all, not merely that
      this run failed to find one.

      Neg\_inf\_cycle certifies neg\_infty\_cycle: a directed closed walk of original arcs, each of
      infinite capacity, whose total cost is negative, so the objective is unbounded below. This is
      the verdict of the acyclifier (acyc\_flow\_opt = None) and of an unbounded loop return alike;
      both are sound for the same reason.

      Note the asymmetry that makes the Infeasible case meaningful: it is a statement about every
      candidate flow, obtained because the artificial edges make the augmented network
      unconditionally feasible, so an augmented optimum that still loads an artificial edge is a
      proof of original infeasibility rather than a failure report.\<close>

      tree\_st art\_tree, whereas NSinit reasons about NS.ns\_loop from the abstract Sarb. The two trees
      are the same record: Sarb is tree\_st of art\_tree once Vseen and Varb are unfolded. So the two
      starting states coincide, and the executable twin agrees with the specification loop on the
      domain, which NSinit.network\_simplex\_correct(1) supplies.\<close>

text \<open>make\_acyclic\_none\_unbounded is reused verbatim. Its balance premise af\_feasible b f0 is

text \<open>Note. The simplifier calls below are deliberately "simp only". Under the NS interpretation

      whose right-hand side contains its own left-hand side. As a [simp] rule it rewrites fst\_all ! e
      to itself forever, so any plain simp on a goal mentioning fst\_all ! e or snd\_all ! e with
      e < m + Kart dischargeable diverges. The same holds for NS.snd\_exec\_eq. Declaring the two

subsection \<open>The unbounded verdict\<close>



subsection \<open>The big-M transfer \<^emph>\<open>(still owed)\<close>\<close>

text \<open>The two feasible verdicts both rest on transferring the augmented optimum
      NSinit.network\_simplex\_correct(3) back to the original network. This is the classical big-M
      argument, and it is the only part of solve\_correct not yet discharged.

      aug\_opt\_zero\_art\_orig\_opt: if the augmented optimum loads no artificial edge it restricts to an
      original b\_lookup-flow, and it is optimal there because every original b\_lookup-flow extends to
      an augmented one of equal cost (put 0 on the artificial edges, which is feasible at the root
      because b\_lookup vcount = 0). This direction needs no bound on bigM.

      aug\_opt\_nonzero\_art\_infeasible: the converse, and the hard one. Suppose an original
      b\_lookup-flow f existed and extend it by 0 to an augmented f'. Then g optimal gives
      C\_aug g <= C\_aug f' = C\_orig f, and C\_aug g = C\_orig g + bigM * t where t is the total
      artificial flow. To contradict t > 0 one needs a lower bound on C\_orig g in terms of C\_orig f
      and t, i.e.

        C\_orig f - C\_orig g <= t * sum\_list (map abs cost\_list).

      Note what this is and is not. Restricted to the original edges g is a b'-flow for a balance b'
      that differs from b only at the artificial endpoints, with total deviation at most 2*t; the
      displayed bound is therefore a *sensitivity* (Lipschitz) statement about the minimum-cost
      function as the balance is perturbed, not a statement about any single path or cycle. It has to
      be proved by decomposing f - g (restricted to the original edges) into paths and cycles, the
      paths carrying at most t units in total; flowcycle\_decomposition in Flow\_Theory/Decomposition.thy
      is the intended starting point.

      Two traps to record, both of which cost a wrong sketch here already.

      First, the bound must be on the *rate*, not the total. Flows are real-valued, so t can be
      arbitrarily small and then bigM * t is small too; no bound of the form "bigM exceeds any
      achievable original cost" closes the argument.

      Second, a per-cycle argument does not work. Decomposing f' - g into residual cycles of g gives
      each cycle a non-negative cost, since g is optimal. But every artificial edge is incident to the
      root, so a *simple* residual cycle that touches the root uses exactly two artificial arcs; if one
      is traversed forwards and the other backwards their bigM contributions cancel, and the cycle's
      non-negative cost yields no contradiction however large bigM is. The cancellation is why the
      argument has to go through the aggregate sensitivity bound above.

      Both lemmas are stated on the abstract flow g of the augmented network; the theorem below feeds
      them NS.ns\_flow\_of (NS.ns\_loop NSinit.init\_state) and the artificial-edge test that solve
      performs.\<close>

text \<open>The loop carries its invariant to the terminal state, so the returned flow array is still long
      enough to be truncated at m. Only the two recursive branches do any work: the terminal ones just
      set the return flag, and ns\_invar does not mention that field.

      The simp del below is not optional. Under the NS interpretation NS.fst\_exec\_eq and
      NS.snd\_exec\_eq are [simp] rules whose right-hand side contains their own left-hand side (see the
      note further down), and unfolding ns\_invar\_tree\_def exposes fst\_all ! ... , at which point a
      plain simp diverges.\<close>

text \<open>Note the shape of the second premise. Stating it with a free k, as in

    and nz: "m <= k" "k < m + Kart" "g k ~= 0"

  exports k as a schematic ?k, so the premise becomes ?g ?k ~= 0: a schematic function applied to a
  schematic argument. Resolving that against a concrete fact is a flex-flex higher-order unification
  problem, and instantiating the lemma with OF then diverges. Binding k with an existential keeps the
  occurrence as ?g applied to a bound variable, which is a Miller pattern and unifies in one step.
  The sibling lemma above is safe for the same reason: its k is bound by the meta-quantifier.\<close>

      ancinv conjunct uses at dfs\_discover. Second, chain\_redge turns a tree edge into the residual arc
      oriented from child to parent, and chain\_redge\_props certifies it is a free real edge of the
      original residual graph with the right endpoints --- the atom the walk-builder assembles into a

subsection \<open>Comparability of free-edge endpoints (covinv) and its discover-step maintenance\<close>

text \<open>covinv: any free real edge whose both endpoints are seen has pstep-comparable endpoints (one is a
      tree-ancestor of the other). Its only non-trivial maintenance is at dfs\_discover: a newly seen w
      and an already-seen free-neighbour a of it must be comparable. free\_neighbor\_on\_stack shows a is on
      the stack (a finished a would, by scan\_complete + block-completeness, already have seen w); then
      stk\_ancestor makes a an ancestor of the stack top v, and w becomes v's child, so (w,a){\isasymin}pstep*.\<close>

subsection \<open>Artificial-edge reverse coverage: every artificial InTree edge is a component-root's edge\<close>

text \<open>art\_owned: for every emitted artificial slot k with tag InTree there is a component root c
      (\<open>ds_prnt c = vcount\<close>) whose parent edge is exactly that slot (\<open>ds_par c = m + k\<close>). This is the
      reverse of cr\_ext\_inv and completes InTree {\isasymsubseteq} T for the artificial range. Threaded like the forward
      cr\_ext machinery: build\_dfs adds no InTree artificial edge and freezes seen roots
      (build\_dfs\_seen\_frozen --- the forward field-freeze proved here), open\_tree\_component installs the new
      root's witness, emit\_U\_edge only adds an InU edge, and the two phase folds carry it with the same
      ds\_nxt {\isasymle} length vs\_list bound (card of a seen-vertex witness set).\<close>

      the signed per-slot flow over the slots already emitted (@{term \<open>k < ds_nxt s\<close>}). Each emission
      --- @{const emit_U_edge} or the seed of @{const open_tree_component} (the enclosed @{const build_dfs}
      freezes the artificial arrays, @{thm build_dfs_art}) --- changes @{term \<open>aex s v\<close>} by exactly
      @{term \<open>- imbalance ! v\<close>} at the processed vertex and @{term \<open>imbalance ! v\<close>} at the root, so over
      a whole phase-1 sweep the increments accumulate as one @{const sum_list}. The @{term E}-witness
      (@{term \<open>ds_nxt s = card E\<close>}) carries the @{term \<open>ds_nxt s < length vs_list\<close>} bound the emission

text \<open>\<^emph>\<open>Pass A's excess for an arbitrary flow.\<close>  @{const excess} is defined as the excess component of
      @{term \<open>passA flow_list\<close>} --- the \<^emph>\<open>frozen\<close> input flow --- but the executable pipeline runs Pass A on
      the \<^emph>\<open>acyclified\<close> flow instead.  The three lemmas below generalise @{thm excess_nth} /
      @{thm excess_is_orig_ex} from @{term flow_list} to any @{term fl} (the underlying fold lemma
      @{thm passA_fold_exc} is already flow-generic), and then close the loop: since the acyclifier
      preserves every vertex's excess (@{thm orig_ex_acyc_eq_excess}) and @{term h} is injective
      (@{thm h_eq_iff}), running Pass A on @{const acyc_flow} yields \<^emph>\<open>literally\<close> @{const excess}.
      This is what lets the imperative refinement identify its in-place excess array --- computed from
      the acyclified flow --- with the functional @{const imbalance}, which is anchored to
      @{const excess}.\<close>
