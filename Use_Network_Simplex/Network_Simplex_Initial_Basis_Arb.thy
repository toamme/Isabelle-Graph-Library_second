text ‹The DFS produces five vertex-indexed arrays (@{const ds_prnt}, @{const ds_thrd}, @{const ds_rvth},
      @{const ds_lsuc}, @{const ds_snum}); here we read them off @{const build_tree} into the abstract
      @{typ ‹nat ndtree›} @{term Sarb}, with root @{term ‹vcount›} and vertex set @{term ‹Varb›}. The vertex
      set is based on the ∗‹seen› set @{term Vseen} (which coincides with the real vertices ‹set vs_list› —
      a bridge deferred to the network-simplex layer); this makes @{const follow} over the parent map and
      @{const children} coincide ∗‹directly› with the array-level @{const pstep}/@{const desc} machinery of
      the correctness theory. We then discharge the @{const arb_invar} obligations (via @{thm arb_invarI})
      that do not require the explicit emission order; the thread-side ones are flagged at the end.›

subsection ‹Thread spanning: the forward thread from the root visits every tree vertex›

text ‹The DFS builds the thread by ∗‹append at the end›: each @{const dfs_discover} /

      @{term ‹(ds_prev s, w)›} at the current last vertex, and the set of vertices reachable from the

      the @{const tspan} carry): at every state, @{term ‹Suc (card (seen vertices))›} equals the root's
      running count plus the subtree size of the ∗‹bottom› (component-root) stack frame — the vertices of
      the currently-open component, not yet added to the root. A discovery grows both sides by one (the
      fresh vertex joins the bottom frame's subtree via @{thm stk_top_reaches} / @{thm desc_discover});
      finishing a component root adds its size to the root; opening a component reseeds the bottom frame.
      At @{const build_tree} the stack is empty, so the bottom term is @{term 0} and the root count is the
      whole tree.›

section ‹Big-M potential arithmetic: the pot_value_plus/minus specifications›

text ‹The abstract potential/reduced-cost descriptor is the tagged pair ‹pval›, read as
      ‹pval_abstract bigM p = of_mtag (fst p) * bigM + snd p›.  With ‹bigM› chosen larger than
      ‹6 * sum_list (map abs cost_list)›, the ordinary parts of a potential (bounded by
      ‹2 * sum_list (map abs cost_list)›, invariant ‹pv_invar›) and of a reduced cost (bounded by
      ‹3 * sum_list (map abs cost_list)›, invariant ‹rc_invar›) are too small to disturb the big-M
      coefficient.  Under the network-simplex guard (‹good_pot_val›: the resulting value is a signed
      cost sum over augmented edges touching the root ‹vcount› at most once), the big-M coefficient
      of the result stays in ‹{- 1, 0, 1}›, so the clamping ‹tag_add› / ‹tag_sub› act faithfully.
      These are exactly the spec-level obligations ‹pot_value_plus_spec› / ‹pot_value_minus_spec› of
      the locale ‹network_simplex_spec›.›

text ‹Design-notes obligation 11 (init_pot_fits), interior case: every interior tree vertex's stored
      parent edge is a real free edge whose reduced cost @{term ‹𝖼 e + π(fst e) - π(snd e)›} is
      ∗‹zero› in the abstract.  This follows directly from the potential recursion @{thm build_tree_pot}
      (the parent's potential plus the @{term M_0}-tagged signed edge cost), so the increment is
      coefficient-0 and hence faithful (‹pval_plus_M0›); the two orientations cancel the cost.›

subsection ‹Obligation 11 (init_pot_fits): reduced cost 0 on every tree edge›

text ‹The interior case (@{thm build_tree_interior_rc_zero}) and the component-root case
      (@{thm build_tree_comproot_rc_zero}) above are now combined into ‹build_tree_rc_zero›,
      the unconditional statement that ∗‹every› seen non-root vertex's parent edge has zero
      reduced cost. The five hypotheses of @{thm build_tree_comproot_rc_zero} are discharged by a
      carried DFS invariant ‹comproot_inv›: at each @{const open_tree_component} the new
      component root @{term c} gets @{term ‹ds_par (build_tree acyc_flow) ! c = m + k›} pointing at its freshly
      emitted artificial edge @{term k} (subject @{term c}) and the seed potential ‹\<mp> bigM›;
      every later step frames those fields (@{const build_dfs} freezes seen vertices' @{const ds_par}
      / @{const ds_pot} / @{const ds_prnt} and never creates a new component root -- ‹build_dfs_cr›).›

subsection ‹Assembly substrate: seen vertices are real vertices (@{term ‹Vseen = set vs_list›})›

text ‹Every vertex the builder ever marks ∗‹seen› (below @{const vcount}) is one of the input
      vertices @{term ‹set vs_list›}: a discovery marks a free-edge endpoint (@{term snd_list} /
      @{term fst_list}, both subsets of @{term ‹set vs_list›} via @{thm fst_snd_vs}), and every component
      root opened by @{const open_tree_component} is a fold element of @{term vs_list}. Combined with
      ‹vs_sub_Vseen› this pins @{term Vseen} to exactly @{term ‹set vs_list›}.›

text ‹Under the dense model a name of @{term vs_list} that carries no edge (@{const is_lonely}) is a
      genuine non-vertex: it has zero @{const excess} (no incident edge contributes) and zero balance
      (@{thm isolated_zero}), hence zero @{const imbalance}, so the builder never opens it — the seen
      set is exactly the edged vertices.  The lemmas below package this for the seen-set invariant.›

text ‹The augmented graph's vertex set @{term ‹NSg.𝒱›} — the endpoint set of all @{term ‹m + Kart›}
      edges — is exactly the arborescence vertex set @{term Varb} (@{term ‹insert vcount (set vs_list)›}):
      real edges contribute @{term ‹set vs_list›} (@{thm fst_snd_vs}), artificial edges contribute
      @{const vcount} together with their subjects, and @{thm Kart_pos} guarantees at least one
